This is the second version of the "Deliverable Two" Coin Flipping project from the Grand Circus Unit 1 pre-work course.

I made it to challenge myself and to make the game more dynamic. I am still new to programming!

Added features include:
- Age verification 
	- Multiple choice questions *(see note below)
- Betting feature 
- A hidden boss fight (if you bet more than you have, and win ;) )
	- Choice to Run or Fight
	- Different chances of winning based on your choices

*Note
- The multiple choice questions, and part of the dialog itself was modeled after a game I used to play as a kid.

- While in 2nd grade, my best friend and I would often break into "Leisure Suit Larry
	in the Land of the Lounge Lizards" that was on his parent's computer.

- When writing this program initially I was reminded of the text-based play from LSL and I wanted to bring a bit of
	that nostalgia back into this project.

- If you've ever played LSL (1987 version), I hope you can enjoy the nostalgia like I did (minus the sleeziness).
